1. 1. Check Node is Upto Date
2. Install VSCode
3. Create React App

```vim
npx create-react-app my-app
```

4. Run react

- react 가 설치되면 아래와 같은 문구가 나오지만 `yarn` 키워드를 사용한 실행은 되지 않는다.
- `npm start`를 사용하여 실행하자

```
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  yarn start
    Starts the development server.

  yarn build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  yarn test

  yarn eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:
```
